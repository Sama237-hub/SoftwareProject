      <section class="tips-details">
        <h2>1. Cleansing</h2>
        <p>Cleansing your face is the first step in any skincare routine. Use a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type to remove dirt, oil, and makeup.</p>
        

        <h2>2. Exfoliation</h2>
        <p>Exfoliate your skin 2-3 times a week to remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture. Avoid harsh scrubs to prevent irritation.</p>
        

        <h2>3. Toning</h2>
        <p>Use a toner to balance your skin’s pH levels and prepare it for better absorption of products. Choose alcohol-free toners for hydration.</p>
        

        <h2>4. Moisturizing</h2>
        <p>Hydrate your skin with a moisturizer that suits your skin type. Even oily skin needs moisture to maintain balance and prevent overproduction of oil.</p>
        

        <h2>5. Sun Protection</h2>
        <p>Apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every morning to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Reapply every 2 hours when outdoors.</p>
